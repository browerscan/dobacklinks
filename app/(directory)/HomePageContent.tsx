          Why Guest Post Sites Actually Matter
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Here's the truth:{" "}
          <strong>94% of online content gets zero external links</strong>. Zero.
          That's like throwing a party and nobody shows up. You need backlinks
          to win at SEO, and guest posting is the fastest way to get them.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Think of backlinks as votes. Google counts votes. More quality votes =
          higher rankings. Simple math. That's why top-ranking pages have{" "}
          <strong>3.8x more backlinks</strong> than positions 2-10. They're
          winning because they have more votes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          And get this:{" "}
          <strong>
            64.9% of link builders use guest posting as their #1 tactic
          </strong>
          . Why? Because it works. You write content for another site, they give
          you a backlink, both sides win. No tricks, no games, just value
          exchange.

          How to Choose Quality Sites (Without Getting Burned)
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Not all guest post sites are created equal. Some are worth $500 per
          link (average cost for quality backlinks), others aren't worth $5.
          Here's how to spot the difference:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
          Check Domain Rating (DR) - The Power Score
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          DR measures link strength. Think of it like horsepower for a car.
          Higher DR = more power transferred to your site. Look for DR 50+
          minimum. DR 70+ is premium territory.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Traffic Tells the Truth</h3>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          A site with real traffic means real humans are reading. No traffic?
          That's a ghost town. You want actual eyeballs, not just link juice.
          Check monthly visits - we show SimilarWeb data for every site so you
          know exactly what you're getting.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
          Google News = Gold Standard
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Sites approved for Google News have been vetted by Google. That's like
          having a seal of approval from the boss. These sites are held to
          higher editorial standards. Worth paying more for.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
          Dofollow Links Only (Usually)
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Nofollow links don't pass SEO juice. They're like giving someone a
          high-five through glass - the gesture is there but nothing transfers.
          Stick with dofollow unless you just want traffic.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Low Spam Score</h3>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Spam score above 10%? Run away. That site is probably doing shady
          stuff that'll eventually get them penalized. When Google drops the
          hammer, you don't want to be associated with them.
